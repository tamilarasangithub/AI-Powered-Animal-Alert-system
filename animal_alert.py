"hello everyone, this is a simple animal alert system that uses YOLOv8 to detect specific animals in real-time from a webcam feed and sends alerts via Telegram. It is designed to help monitor wildlife or pets by sending notifications when certain animals are detected. The code includes functionality for capturing images, processing them with a pre-trained YOLO model, and sending alerts with the detected animal information. Let's take a look at the code below:"
"this my animal alert system using YOLOv8 and Telegram"
"my name is [Tamilarasan], and I am excited to share this project with you. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, and the YOLOv8 model for object detection. It continuously monitors a webcam feed, detects specified animals, and sends alerts through Telegram when these animals are detected. This can be particularly useful for wildlife monitoring or pet surveillance. Below is the complete code for the animal alert system."
